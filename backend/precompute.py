    apply_counted_num_ratings and apply_counted_rmp_rating enforce on the RMP
    side. Everything downstream reads the sum as a precision: the GOATED review
    floor, the shrinkage weight, and the "Ratings" column beside the rating.

    It used to sum `completed` off one arbitrary question row per section
    (`drop_duplicates` keeps whichever row the frame happened to hold first),
    which was wrong three ways. `completed` counts students who submitted the
    survey, not students who answered the overall question. It is not constant
    across a section's question rows — 5,554 of 55,049 sections carry more than
    one value, some rows reporting 0 — so the total moved with row order. And
    sections whose survey form has no overall item at all counted in full toward
    a rating they contribute nothing to: 79 of Susan Sieloff's 83 sections, whose
    338 became 21.

    own name is in it already has a TRACE identity, so there is no other
    spelling to go looking for and any match would be to someone else. Michaela
    Lewis has nine TRACE courses and no survey responses at all; her
    trace_overall was NaN for want of scores, not for want of a name, and the
    match handed her Michael Lewis's Law courses and comments in production.

    prof_aliases.FUZZY_DENY covers the rest by hand. Yan Li has no TRACE courses
    under her own name, so nothing here distinguishes her from a nickname and

# See docs/rating-blend-calibration.md for the measurements behind this.
#
# RMP and TRACE measure the same thing (corr +0.87 among well-evidenced
# professors) on different scales: RMP runs ~0.8 lower and is 2.4x wider, because
# it is voluntary and negatively self-selected while TRACE is administered to
# everyone. So the blend is two steps:
#
#   1. project RMP onto the TRACE scale using a fit refit from the data
#   2. pool the two by inverse variance, weighting each side by how many
#      responses it actually has and how precise a response is *on the TRACE
#      scale* (w = n * slope^2 / sigma^2)
#
# The old rule was (rmp + trace) / 2, which did neither: one RMP review carried
# the same weight as 300 TRACE responses, so a single 1-star could drag a
# well-liked professor to 2.81.
#
# Applies only to professors with *both* sources. Single-source professors keep
# their raw source rating — calibrating them would move 5,269 more ratings with
# no second source to check against.
#
# Both steps have to agree about which scale they are on, and getting that wrong
# is silent: an earlier version fitted with ordinary least squares and weighted
# with w = n / sigma^2, leaving sigma^2_rmp measured in RMP units while the value
# it weighted had already been divided by the slope. That understated RMP's
# precision by slope^2 (~3.6x) and collapsed the blend to TRACE-with-a-nudge —
# RMP moved the displayed number for 1.5% of two-source professors. Validated by
# hold-out (see the doc): the pair of fixes cuts RMSE against a well-measured
# TRACE truth by 36% at thin TRACE evidence, and improves 445 of 622 professors.
# Re-exported, not redefined: server.py fits the same mapping from the catalog to
# show a reader the projected RMP value the blend actually used, and two copies of
# a threshold that has to match is how the tooltip drifted out of agreement with
# the number beside it in the first place. Names stay on this module so
# measure_calibration and test_rating_blend read them where they always did.

    well-evidenced overlap to fit, or when the fit comes out degenerate (a slope
    at or below CALIBRATION_MIN_SLOPE would blow up the inverse projection).

    Slope is the ratio of standard deviations (reduced major axis), not the OLS
    coefficient, because this fit exists to be *inverted*. OLS minimises error in
    rmp given trace, so inverting it over-disperses: it stretches the projected
    values by 1/corr (measured 1.42x wider than TRACE's own spread). Matching the
    two spreads is what "project onto the TRACE scale" has to mean for the
