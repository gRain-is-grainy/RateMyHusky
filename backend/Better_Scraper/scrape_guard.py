"""Data-refresh guardrails: absolute + relative row-count floors.

A broken or rate-limited scrape must not overwrite good data. These floors ran
as a bash block inside data-refresh.yml, where nothing exercised them until the
weekly cron fired. They live here so ci.yml's pytest job covers them.

Two layers, both checked before any DB or data-store write:

  absolute  Catches catastrophic failures (a 403-blocked scrape writing a
            header-only CSV) and covers the first run, when there is no
            baseline to compare against. Set at ~80% of the healthy count.

  relative  Catches degraded scrapes that clear the absolute floor anyway:
            3,200 professors beats the 3,100 floor and would then force-push
            over the only copy of good data. 98% of last week's store, applied
            to every file rather than just the RMP pair.

Stdlib only, deliberately: the workflow installs requirements-data.txt (which
has pandas) but ci.yml's test job installs requirements.txt (which does not),
and one code path that CI actually runs beats a faster one it never touches.

Usage:
    python Better_Scraper/scrape_guard.py baseline --data-dir DIR --out FILE
    python Better_Scraper/scrape_guard.py check --data-dir DIR [--baseline FILE]
                                               [--accept-lower]
