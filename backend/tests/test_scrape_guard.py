"""The data-refresh guardrails, as a tested module instead of inline bash.

A broken or rate-limited scrape must not overwrite good data. The floors that
enforce that lived in a bash block inside data-refresh.yml, where nothing ran
them until the weekly cron fired — and the one cron that has fired, failed.

Two layers, both checked before any DB or data-store write:
  - absolute floors catch catastrophic failures and cover the first run, when
    there is no baseline to compare against,
  - a relative floor against the pre-scrape baseline catches degraded scrapes
    that clear the absolute floor anyway. 3,100 professors beats the 3,000
    floor and would then force-push over the only copy of good data.

The relative floor is 98%, not the 95% that shipped: the observed week-over-week
delta is +49 reviews on 44,508, so 95% tolerates losing 2,225 real reviews.

Counting (I/O) is separate from the floor policy (pure), so the policy tests
carry realistic row counts without writing 1.5M lines to disk.

No database and no network.
