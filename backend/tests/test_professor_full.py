"""Unit tests for the extracted, injectable /full SQL orchestration.

These prove the round-trip reduction (a fake `query` records every call) and
guard the unauthenticated response shape. server.py can't be imported in tests
(it needs live env vars), so the logic lives in professor_full.py with the same
injectable-`query` pattern as chat_retrieve.py.
