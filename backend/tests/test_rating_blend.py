"""Tests for the displayed rating blend (calibrate, then pool by precision).

Background: avg_rating used to be (rmp_rating + trace_rating) / 2, which averaged
two measurements on different scales while ignoring how many responses stood
behind each. One RMP review counted as much as 300 TRACE responses, so Eno Ebong
displayed 2.81 off a single 1-star against 300 TRACE responses at 4.62; 135
professors were shown more than a full point from what their evidence supported.

The replacement projects RMP onto the TRACE scale with a fit refit each run, then
pools by inverse variance. See docs/rating-blend-calibration.md.

No database: every function here is pure, driven by synthetic arrays.
