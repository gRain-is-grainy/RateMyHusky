"""A topics code must not serve a single course-level rating.

46 course codes are flagged on the 2026-08-12 export (105,376 rows): they run
under more than one *unrelated* title inside a single term — HONR3310 as
"Election 2024", "Honors Seminar" and "Language and Power" at once; ARTE3901 as
"ST: Assistive Design" and "ST: History of Comics". The code is a container for
unrelated classes, so averaging their TRACE scores together produces a number
that describes nothing. The page showed it anyway, and it also fed the
AggregateRating JSON-LD and the catalog sort.

67 codes carry more than one distinct title in a term; the other 21 are one title
written two ways and are deliberately not flagged, since a false positive removes
a real course's rating. Nearly all 21 differ only in a stripped ampersand
("Financl Accounting  Reporting" / "Financl Accounting & Reporting"), which
titles_are_variants absorbs through its abbreviation rule.

precompute flags these (course_catalog.is_topics) and leaves avg_rating NULL for
them; the API suppresses avgRating/ratingCount and says so with isTopics. The
per-section and per-instructor ratings are untouched — those are real.

SELECT * plus .get("is_topics") means a catalog built before the column existed
still serves: absent reads as "not a topics code".
