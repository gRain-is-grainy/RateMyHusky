"""Load NUBanner sections to CockroachDB.

Own tables, disjoint from everything backend/pipeline rebuilds. That separation
is the point: the pipeline swaps its tables in fresh every run,
while this history is expensive to re-fetch (one request per section) and
closed terms never change.

Three tables:

  banner_terms                 one row per term code ever scraped, with the
                               counts the next scrape's gates compare against
  banner_sections              one row per section (term_code, crn), TBA
                               sections included
  banner_section_instructors   one row per (term_code, crn, instructor)

A term is written as a unit: its old rows are deleted and the new ones inserted
in one transaction, after every gate in banner_scrape has passed. Nothing
outside the term being written is touched, so history accumulates.

`connect()` deliberately overrides the DSN's `sslmode=verify-full` with
`sslmode="require"` — the deployment does not distribute a root cert, so
verify-full fails outright before any query runs. This matches existing
precedent (`load_reddit_to_crdb.py`, `backend/pipeline/db.py`); do not "fix"
it back to the bare DSN.

Instructors for closed terms before --instructors-from (default Fall 2025)
came from a one-off import instead of ~7,000 Banner requests a term; those
terms are scraped sections-only here, and their instructor rows (source
'import') are left as they are. The import is not Banner data, so the matcher
reads only source = 'banner' rows; re-scraping those terms with instructors
(--instructors-from set lower) is what would bring them into the history.

Staging: --local-db PATH writes to a sqlite file instead of CockroachDB, so the
Banner traffic can happen once, offline from the database. --push-from PATH then
copies a staged file into CockroachDB without touching Banner.

Usage
-----
    python load_banner_to_crdb.py --selftest                 # offline DDL check
    python load_banner_to_crdb.py                            # open terms (weekly)
    python load_banner_to_crdb.py --backfill                 # closed terms since Fall 2021
    python load_banner_to_crdb.py --backfill --max-sections 30000 --since 202410
    python load_banner_to_crdb.py --local-db stage.db --backfill
    python load_banner_to_crdb.py --push-from stage.db

A stage pushed over prod is gated against prod's own counts, and a staged
sections-only term never touches prod's instructor rows.
