"""Course and instructor history from stored Banner sections. Pure functions.

Who taught this course, when, and to how many
students — rebuilt from Banner, which keeps every section back to 2009. Two
outputs, each one row per thing a page shows:

  course_instructors   (subject_course, instructor): terms taught, sections,
                       typical class size, campuses, formats. Read by subject
                       for a course page, by slug for a professor page.
  course_offerings     subject_course: when it runs (Fall / Spring / Summer
                       pattern), typical class size, how many people teach it,
                       credit hours, and whether it is on the current schedule.

Scope: what puts a review in context — who taught what, when, and to how big a
room — summarised across terms, plus two basics a course page needs (credits,
offered this term). The rest of what a student reads to register (seats,
waitlists, NUpath, campus and format of the course) is SearchNEU's job, not
ours, and is deliberately absent.

Nothing here touches the network or a database; match_banner_instructors.py
reads the rows and writes the results.
